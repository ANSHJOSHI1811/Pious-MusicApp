 I have developed a feature-rich music player web application using React 18, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and RapidAPI. It allows you to play, pause, and skip tracks, create and manage playlists, and explore a vast library of songs. The app has a user-friendly interface and includes a search feature for easy music discovery.
